  <string name="MedicationTypeSSRI">Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors;SSRI;SSRIs comprise the majority of prescription antidepressants, acting in the brain to increase serotonin levels by preventing its absorption. It is interesting to note that the majority of this neurotransmitter in the body is to be found in the gastrointestinal tract.  It is commonly believed to be responsible for regulating mood and, therefore, blocking its reabsorption increases its level and enhances feelings of well-being.</string>
  <string name="MedicationTypeSNRI">Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors;SNRI;Whilst serotonin is associated with feelings of well-being, norepinephrine (or noradrenaline) is closely tied with the human \'fight-or-flight\' response, preparing the body (and brain) for action. Neurotransmitters provide a chemical \'messenger\' system, used for communication between cells. Both serotonin and norepinephrine are neurotransmitters.</string>
  <string name="MedicationTypeSMAS">Serotonin Modulators And Stimulators;SMAS;Serotonin modulators and stimulators were developed because there are more than a single type of serotonin receptor. SMASs work on a number of serotonin receptors, blocking the absorption of serotonin in much the same way as SSRIs. There is also an impact on receptors in the gastrointestinal tract which smooths the nauseous side-effects and, therefore, improving tolerabiity of the medication.</string>
  <string name="MedicationTypeSARI">Serotonin Antagonists and Reuptake Inhibitors;SARI;As with most reuptake inhibitors, SARIs block the binding of serotonin to receptors in the brain, improving mood by increasing the level of serotonin. SARIs have an additional function in that they prevent serotonin binding to certain other receptors and, instead, redirect it to other cells which further increase mood by allowing them to function better.</string>
  <string name="MedicationTypeNRI">Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors;NRI;Norepinephrine (or noradrenaline) is closely tied with the human \'fight-or-flight\' response, preparing the body (and brain) for action. Reuptake inhibition works to decrease hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour, particularly in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and allows improved attentions span.</string>
  <string name="MedicationTypeTCA">Tricyclic Antidepressants;TCA;Discovered in the 1950\'s, the first wave of antidepressants were tricyclic, so called because it describes the number of \'rings\' of atoms (3) in the chemical structure of the compound. Modern compounds are now favoured, due to the number of possible side-effects from TCAs, but are still prescribed for treatment resistant cases (in addition to treatment for migraine, PMS and more). Like other antidepressants, TCAs block the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.</string>
  <string name="MedicationTypeTeCA">Tetracyclic Antidepressants;TeCA;First seen in the early 1970\'s, Tetracyclic antidepressants are very closely related to tricyclic antidepressants, and are named for the fact that there are four \'rings\' of atoms in the structure of the compound.</string>
  <string name="MedicationTypeMAOI">Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors;MAOI;MAOIs act on an enzyme called \'monoamine oxidase\'. The enzyme regulates the removal of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters in the body, and MAOIs seek to prevent this from happening. MAOIs were the first type of antidepressants to be used, and patients are required to modify their diet as consuming certain foods whilst taking a MAOI can cause extremely high blood pressure. Replaced by more modern antidepressants with fewer side-effects.</string>
  <string name="MedicationTypeATAP">Atypical Antipsychotics;ATAP;Atypical antipsychotics are generally used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder and Major Depressive Disorder (where psychotic episodes are noted). Psychosis can include delusion, paranoia and hallucinations (both visual and auditory). ATAPs work by blocking dopamine and serotonin in the brain and replace the older \'typical antipsychotics\' since there are fewer side-effects.</string>

  <string name="ResourcesMedicationTypeTitleSNRIs">Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</string>
  <string name="ResourcesMedicationTypeDescriptionSNRIs">Whilst seratonin is associated with feelings of well-being, norepinephrine (or noradrenaline) is closely tied with the human \'fight-or-flight\' response, preparing the body (and brain) for action. Neurotransmitters provide a chemical \'messenger\' system, used for communication between cells. Both serotonin and norepinephrine are neurotransmitters.</string>
  <string name="ResourcesMedicationNameTitleDesvenlafaxine">Desvenlafaxine</string>
  <string name="ResourcesMedicationUsesDesvenlafaxine">Desvenlafaxine is an active component (metabolite) of the SNRI Venlafaxine (70% of a dose of Venlafaxine is metabolised in the body as desvenlafaxine). Desvenlafaxine is the synthetic form of this metabolite.</string>

  <string name="ResourcesMedicationTypeTitleSerotoninmodulatorsandstimulators">Serotonin modulators and stimulators</string>
  <string name="ResourcesMedicationTypeDescriptionSerotoninmodulatorsandstimulators">Serotonin modulators and stimulators were developed because there are more than a single type of serotonin receptor. SMASs work on a number of serotonin receptors, blocking the absorption of serotonin in much the same way as SSRIs. There is also an impact on receptors in the gastrointestinal tract which smooths the nauseous side-effects and, therefore, improving tolerabiity of the medication.</string>

Acute stress reaction may develop into delayed stress reaction or better known as PTSD if stress isn\'t correctly managed.</string>
  <string name="ConditionAgoraphobiaDescription">Anxiety disorder characterized by symptoms of anxiety in situations where the person perceives the environment to be unsafe with no easy way to get away. These situations can include open spaces, public transit, shopping malls, or simply being outside the home. Being in these situations may result in a panic attack. The symptoms occur nearly every time the situation is encountered and lasts for more than six months. Those affected will go to great lengths to avoid these situations. In severe cases people may become unable to leave their homes. The cause of agoraphobia is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The condition often runs in families, and stressful events such as the death of a parent or being attacked may be a trigger.</string>
  <string name="ConditionAmnesticdisorderDescription">A deficit in memory caused by brain damage, disease, or psychological trauma. Amnesia can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs. The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused. There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an accident or operation. In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store. People with this type of amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to the medial temporal lobe.</string>
  <string name="ConditionAnorexianervosaDescription">An eating disorder characterized by a low weight, fear of gaining weight, a strong desire to be thin, and food restriction. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight. If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods. The cause is not known.</string>
  <string name="ConditionAttentiondeficitdisorderDescription">A mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person\'s age. These symptoms begin by age six to twelve, are present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. The cause is not known.</string>
  <string name="ConditionBereavementDescription">Response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, and grief is the reaction to that loss. Grief is a natural response to loss. It is the emotional suffering one feels when something or someone the individual loves is taken away. The grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve in connection with a variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship. Loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract, the physical loss being related to something that the individual can touch or measure, such as losing a spouse through death, while other types of loss are abstract, and relate to aspects of a person\’s social interactions.</string>
  <string name="ConditionbipolardisorderDescription">A mental disorder that causes periods of depression and periods of elevated mood. The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 30–40 percent. Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are commonly associated. The causes are not clearly understood</string>
  <string name="ConditionBodydysmorphicdisorderDescription">A mental disorder characterized by an obsessive preoccupation that some aspect of one\'s own appearance is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix it. In BDD\'s delusional variant, the flaw is imagined. If the flaw is actual, its importance is severely exaggerated. Either way, one\'s thoughts about it are pervasive and intrusive, occupying up to several hours a day.</string>
  <string name="ConditionBorderlinepersonalitydisorderDescription">A long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by unstable relationships with other people, unstable sense of self, and unstable emotions. There is often an extreme fear of abandonment, frequent dangerous behavior, a feeling of emptiness, and self-harm. Symptoms may be brought on by seemingly normal events. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of situations. Substance abuse, depression, and eating disorders are commonly associated with BPD. BPD increases the risk of self-harm and 10% of people affected die by suicide. BPD\'s causes are unclear</string>
  <string name="ConditionBulimianervosaDescription">An eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to the attempts to get rid of the food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking laxatives. Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise. Most people with bulimia are at a normal weight. The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth. Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and problems with drugs or alcohol. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm. The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%</string>
  <string name="ConditionDissociativeidentitydisorderDescription">A mental disorder characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring identities or dissociated personality states that alternately show in a person\'s behavior, accompanied by memory impairment for important information not explained by ordinary forgetfulness. These symptoms are not accounted for by substance abuse, seizures, other medical conditions, nor by imaginative play in children. Diagnosis is often difficult as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders. Malingering should be considered if there is possible financial or forensic gain, as well as factitious disorder if help-seeking behavior is prominent. No clear consensus on diagnostic criteria or treatment</string>
  <string name="ConditionEkbomsSyndromeDescription">A delusional disorder in which individuals incorrectly believe they are infested with parasites, insects, or bugs, whereas in reality no such infestation is present. Individuals with delusional parasitosis usually report tactile hallucinations known as formication, a sensation resembling insects crawling on or under the skin.</string>
  <string name="ConditionErotomaniaDescription">Delusional disorder where the affected person believes that another person is in love with him or her. This belief is usually applied to someone with higher status or a famous person, but can also be applied to a complete stranger. Erotomanic delusions often occur in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, but can also occur during a manic episode in the context of bipolar I disorder. During an erotomanic delusion, the patient believes that a secret admirer is declaring his or her affection for the patient, often by special glances, signals, telepathy, or messages through the media. Usually the patient then returns the perceived affection by means of letters, phone calls, gifts, and visits to the unwitting recipient. Even though these advances are unexpected and often unwanted, any denial of affection by the object of this delusional love is dismissed by the patient as a ploy to conceal the forbidden love from the rest of the world</string>
  <string name="ConditionGeneralizedanxietydisorderDescription">An anxiety disorder characterized by excessive, uncontrollable and often irrational worry, that is, apprehensive expectation about events or activities. This excessive worry often interferes with daily functioning, as individuals with GAD typically anticipate disaster, and are overly concerned about everyday matters such as health issues, money, death, family problems, friendship problems, interpersonal relationship problems, or work difficulties. Individuals often exhibit a variety of physical symptoms, including fatigue, fidgeting, headaches, nausea, numbness in hands and feet, muscle tension, muscle aches, difficulty swallowing, excessive stomach acid buildup, stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, bouts of breathing difficulty, difficulty concentrating, trembling, twitching, irritability, agitation, sweating, restlessness, insomnia, hot flashes, rashes, and inability to fully control the anxiety</string>
  <string formatted="false" name="ConditionHistrionicpersonalitydisorderDescription">A personality disorder characterized by a pattern of excessive attention-seeking emotions, usually beginning in early adulthood, including inappropriately seductive behavior and an excessive need for approval. Histrionic people are lively, dramatic, vivacious, enthusiastic, and flirtatious. HPD affects four times as many women as men. It has a prevalence of 2–3% in the general population and 10–15% in inpatient and outpatient mental health institutions.</string>
  <string name="ConditionHypochondriasisDescription">Worry about having a serious illness. This debilitating condition is the result of an inaccurate perception of the condition of body or mind despite the absence of an actual medical condition. An individual suffering from hypochondriasis is known as a hypochondriac. Hypochondriacs become unduly alarmed about any physical or psychological symptoms they detect, no matter how minor the symptom may be, and are convinced that they have, or are about to be diagnosed with, a serious illness. Often, hypochondria persists even after a physician has evaluated a person and reassured them that their concerns about symptoms do not have an underlying medical basis or, if there is a medical illness, their concerns are far in excess of what is appropriate for the level of disease. Many hypochondriacs focus on a particular symptom as the catalyst of their worrying, such as gastro-intestinal problems, palpitations, or muscle fatigue</string>
  <string name="ConditionIntermittentexplosivedisorderDescription">A behavioral disorder characterized by explosive outbursts of anger and violence, often to the point of rage, that are disproportionate to the situation at hand (e.g., impulsive screaming triggered by relatively inconsequential events). Impulsive aggression is unpremeditated, and is defined by a disproportionate reaction to any provocation, real or perceived. Some individuals have reported affective changes prior to an outburst (e.g., tension, mood changes, energy changes, etc.)</string>
  <string name="ConditionKleptomaniaDescription">The inability to refrain from the urge for stealing items and is usually done for reasons other than personal use or financial gain. First described in 1816, kleptomania is classified in psychiatry as an impulse control disorder. Some of the main characteristics of the disorder, suggest that kleptomania could be an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder regularly associated with other psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and eating disorders, and alcohol and substance abuse</string>
  <string formatted="false" name="ConditionMajorDepressiveDisorderDescription">A mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affects a person\'s personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder. The cause is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors</string>
  <string name="ConditionMinordepressivedisorderDescription">A mood disorder that does not meet the full criteria for major depressive disorder but at least two depressive symptoms are present for two weeks. These symptoms can be seen in many different psychiatric and mental disorders, which can lead to more specific diagnoses of an individual\'s condition. A person is considered to have minor depressive disorder if he or she experiences 2 to 4 depressive symptoms, with one of them being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, during a 2-week period. The person must not have experienced the symptoms for 2 years and there must not a one specific event that caused the symptoms to arise.</string>
  <string name="ConditionMunchausenssyndromeDescription">A psychiatric factitious disorder wherein those affected feign disease, illness, or psychological trauma to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves. Munchausen syndrome fits within the subclass of factitious disorder with predominantly physical signs and symptoms, but patients also have a history of recurrent hospitalization, travelling, and dramatic, extremely improbable tales of their past experiences. The condition derives its name from Baron Munchausen.</string>
  <string name="ConditionNarcissisticpersonalitydisorderDescription">A long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive need for admiration, and a lack of understanding of others feelings. People affected by it often spend a lot of time thinking about achieving power or success, or about their appearance. They often take advantage of the people around them. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of situations. The cause of narcissistic personality disorder is unknown.</string>
  <string name="ConditionObsessivecompulsivedisorderDescription">A mental disorder where people feel the need to check things repeatedly, perform certain routines repeatedly (called \'rituals\'), or have certain thoughts repeatedly. People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time. Common activities include hand washing, counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked. Some may have difficulty throwing things out. These activities occur to such a degree that the person\'s daily life is negatively affected. Often they take up more than an hour a day. Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense. The condition is associated with tics, anxiety disorder, and an increased risk of suicide. The cause is unknown.</string>
  <string name="ConditionObsessivecompulsivepersonalitydisorderDescription">A personality disorder characterized by a general pattern of concern with orderliness, perfectionism, excessive attention to details, mental and interpersonal control, and a need for control over one\'s environment, at the expense of flexibility, openness to experience, and efficiency. Workaholism and miserliness are also seen often in those with this personality disorder. Rituals are performed to the point of excluding leisure activities and friendships. Persons affected with this disorder may find it hard to relax, always feeling that time is running out for their activities, and that more effort is needed to achieve their goals. They may plan their activities down to the minute—a manifestation of the compulsive tendency to keep control over their environment and to dislike unpredictable things as things they cannot control. The cause of OCPD is unknown.</string>
  <string name="ConditionPanicdisorderDescription">An anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear that may include palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness, or a feeling that something really bad is going to happen. The maximum degree of symptoms occurs within minutes. There may be ongoing worries about having further attacks and avoidance of places where attacks have occurred in the past. The cause of panic disorder is unknown.</string>
  <string name="ConditionParanoidpersonalitydisorderDescription">A mental disorder characterized by paranoia and a pervasive, long-standing suspiciousness and generalized mistrust of others. Individuals with this personality disorder may be hypersensitive, easily insulted, and habitually relate to the world by vigilant scanning of the environment for clues or suggestions that may validate their fears or biases. Paranoid individuals are eager observers. They think they are in danger and look for signs and threats of that danger, potentially not appreciating other evidence.</string>
  <string name="ConditionPsychosisDescription">An abnormal condition of the mind that involves a \'loss of contact with reality\'. People experiencing psychosis may exhibit personality changes and thought disorder. Depending on its severity, this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre behavior, as well as difficulty with social interaction and impairment in carrying out daily life activities. Psychosis as a sign of a psychiatric disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion. That is, a new-onset episode of psychosis is not considered a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded</string>
  <string name="ConditionPosttraumaticstressdisorderDescription">A mental disorder that can develop after a person is exposed to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, or other threats on a person\'s life. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in how a person thinks and feels, and increased arousal. These symptoms last for more than a month after the event. Young children are less likely to show distress but instead may express their memories through play. Those with PTSD are at a higher risk of suicide.</string>
  <string name="ConditionSchizophreniaDescription">A mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety disorders, major depressive illness, or substance use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time. The causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors. Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, cannabis use, certain infections, parental age, and poor nutrition during pregnancy. Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants.</string>
  <string name="ConditionSeasonalaffectivedisorderDescription">A mood disorder subset in which people who have normal mental health throughout most of the year experience depressive symptoms at the same time each year, most commonly in the winter.</string>
  <string name="ConditionSelectivemutismDescription">An anxiety disorder in which a person who is normally capable of speech does not speak in specific situations or to specific people. Selective mutism usually co-exists with shyness or social anxiety. People with selective mutism stay silent even when the consequences of their silence include shame, social ostracism or even punishment. Selective mutism affects about 0.8% of people at some point in their lives.</string>
  <string name="ConditionSeparationanxietydisorderDescription">An anxiety disorder in which an individual experiences excessive anxiety regarding separation from home or from people to whom the individual has a strong emotional attachment (e.g. a parent, caregiver, significant other or siblings). It is most common in infants and small children, typically between the ages of 6–7 months to 3 years. Separation anxiety is a natural part of the developmental process. Unlike SAD (indicated by excessive anxiety), normal separation anxiety indicates healthy advancements in a child\’s cognitive maturation and should not be considered a developing behavioral problem. According to the American Psychology Association, separation anxiety disorder is an excessive display of fear and distress when faced with situations of separation from the home or from a specific attachment figure. The anxiety that is expressed is categorized as being atypical of the expected developmental level and age. The severity of the symptoms ranges from anticipatory uneasiness to full-blown anxiety about separation.</string>
  <string name="ConditionSocialanxietydisorderDescription">An anxiety disorder characterized by a significant amount of fear in one or more social situations causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function in at least some parts of daily life. These fears can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny from others. Physical symptoms often include excessive blushing, excess sweating, trembling, palpitations, and nausea. Stammering may be present, along with rapid speech. Panic attacks can also occur under intense fear and discomfort. Some sufferers may use alcohol or other drugs to reduce fears and inhibitions at social events. It is common for sufferers of social phobia to self-medicate in this fashion, especially if they are undiagnosed, untreated, or both; this can lead to alcoholism, eating disorders or other kinds of substance abuse.</string>

  <string name="StrategyTitleSimpleLife">Make life simple for yourself.</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextSimpleLife">Depression is a difficult journey to navigate and we can sometimes feel guilty, or left out, when we are unable to participate in activities. Set yourself goals that you are comfortable with - you can use the Structured Plan to help you achieve this - and allow yourself to do what you feel able to do. You CAN do less when you feel low, but remember to congratulate yourself for the things you have achieved. Record these in Achievements so you can be reminded of the positive things you have done.</string>

  <string name="StrategyTitleJournal">Keep a journal.</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextJournal">Writing in a journal can help you to bring your emotions out, and you can look back on your entries when you feel a little better and, perhaps, see them in a different light. Expressing things in this way can really help you make sense of things. One of the ways I have done this is by keeping a video log (vLog) - when I look back at some of the earlier logs I have made I can see how far I have come, and the progress I have made.</string>
  
  <string name="StrategyTitleReadBooks">Read books or listen to music.</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextReadBooks">Try not to let your depression define who you are - you are an interesting, complex and thoughtful individual, traits you share with all other human beings. Let fantasy fly by reading novels, or float off to your favourite music. Appreciate every word, every note, and you will soon realise that it makes you feel better. I know every note of my favourite jazz piano solo, and it\'s great to just follow along, or pretend I can play by tapping the table - it really does work!</string>
  
  <string name="StrategyTitleFindGroups">Find local groups.</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextFindGroups">It is very likely that there is a group near you that is able to provide support, or counseling, and more. We can sometimes forget that 1 in 4 of us will encounter depression in our lives, and we are most definitely NOT alone in this. There are many companies that have assistance programs for their employees that may include help and support for mental health issues.</string>
  
  <string name="StrategyTitleIsolate">Don\'t isolate yourself.</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextIsolate">This is a very common thing for those with depression to do. The problem is that isolation can easily lead to feelings of loneliness, and your illness will exacerbate those feelings - you may feel that no-one cares, but that is simply not true. I know this from bitter experience - it becomes a difficult spiral to overcome. Try to get together with family or friends, ignore that pang of panic, and say \'yes\'. Join a local support group and meet others who know what you\'re going through, and share your experiences with them.</string>
  
  <string name="StrategyTitleRelax">Learn to relax.</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextRelax">Try meditating or yoga. A gentle martial art, such as Tai Chi, or going for a swim, can be a great way to de-stress your body and mind. It can also be a good way to meet other people and extend your social network.</string>
  
  <string name="StrategyTitleRoutine">Make a routine.</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextRoutine">The saying goes that we are creatures of habit, and having a structured daily routine can take some of the stress out of your life. Use the Activities Planner to help you structure your days over the course of a week. It will give you a sense of achievement, but remember not to over-do things and allow yourself the freedom not to stick to it if you\'re just not up to it. It takes time, but you WILL see the improvement.</string>
  
  <string name="StrategyTitleNoDecisions">Don\'t make important decisions when you\'re feeling low.</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextNoDecisions">Those things can wait - depression has a way of making you unable to think, or see things, clearly. Try out the Problem Solving part of MYM\'s Treatment Plan - it will help you to define a problem and break it down into more manageable steps. You will find it an aid to focusing your thoughts better, knowing that you don\'t have to resolve it straight away. Review the problem, or decision, and you may find you have further ideas that can be incorporated. After I designed this part of MYM, I then used it to plan the remaining sections of this app - handy indeed!</string>
  
  <string name="StrategyTitleDoEnjoy">Do things that you enjoy — even when you don\’t feel like it.</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextDoEnjoy">It\'s easy to lose our way when feeling depressed; those things that used to give us pleasure don\'t seem to have the effect they once did - or so our thinking tells us. Just writing this paragraph prompted me to put on some music that I haven\'t listened to in quite a while - and now I\'m tapping to the music instead of tapping my keyboard! Why not return to a hobby, or sport, that you once liked? Dust off that musical instrument you used to play, or paint, write - whatever it is, there once was a reason you enjoyed doing it - remember how that felt.</string>
  
  <string name="StrategyTitleExercise">Get some exercise.</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextExercise">I think we all instinctively know that even a moderate amount of exercise has the effect of releasing natural endorphins, improving mood. Again, as with any of the preceding strategies, it is important to know that you should not feel bound to do anything if you are not up to it - and that is okay! Perhaps simply a walk around the block or going to the park may be a good starting point. Swimming is also a very good form of exercise.</string>
  
  <string name="StrategyTitleNegativeThoughts">Challenge negative thinking</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextNegativeThoughts">Whilst some propose mindfulness techniques as the road to wellness, others propose talking therapies or medication. In truth, depression is a complex illness that likely requires a multi-pronged approach. It is true, however, that depression can distort ones thinking processes, skewing the reality of any given situation, and it can be immensely helpful to identify and scrutinise these automatic thoughts. An excellent way to do this is via the MYM Thought Records. It allows you to look objectively at a given situation, and reason why it may be negative and, in addition, how this effects your mood. It\'s a great way to track your moods too - I often use this myself, when my GP asks how I\'ve been feeling lately I simply show her my Progress chart, helping her to tailor any ongoing further treatment.</string>
  
  <string name="StrategyTitleAlcohol">Try not to drink too much alcohol.</string>
  <string name="StrategyTextAlcohol">It is easy to self-medicate when depressed. Some take increased doses of their medication, turn to street drugs or drink excessively. Having done all three, I know that whilst there is some short-term relief from the pain, in the longer term it only adds to ones problems, as well as making the depression more acute.</string>

  <string name="wordHelp">Help</string>
  
  <string name="AngerThinkBeforeTitle">Think before reacting or speaking</string>
  <string name="AngerThinkBeforeText">Anger can often lead to explosive outbursts, and rational thinking can take a back seat to aggressive behaviour. It is at these times where we may say and do things we will later regret, knowing that we didn\'t really mean to say and do those things, but lashing out all the same. Allowing yourself the time to think about your responses can, in itself, help to diffuse those feelings of anger.  Thinking clearly in those situations will help you to gain perspective, counter the aggression, and allow you to make your case without drawing others into an argument.</string>

  <string name="AngerTimeoutTitle">Take a timeout</string>
  <string name="AngerTimeoutText">It can be difficult to cope with your own anger if someone else is angry and being aggressive towards you also. Taking a timeout can work wonders in calming down a potentially damaging confrontation, not just for yourself, but for others too. Getting away for even a short time will give you breathing space and a chance to rationalise the situation. Try to think of ways you can avoid any situation from escalating. Could you use humour? Would being sympathetic help, or looking at things from the other persons perspective?</string>
  
  <string name="AngerExerciseTitle">Get some exercise</string>
  <string name="AngerExerciseText">Vigourous exercise is a good way to help rid yourself of the frustration, or anger, you may be feeling. Do it in a constructive way, by allowing the workout to rid you of tension rather than letting anger give you strength during the exercise. Try not to dwell on what makes you angry but focus on the knowledge that you will feel better having exercised.</string>
  
  <string name="AngerRelaxationTitle">Practise relaxation and meditation techniques</string>
  <string name="AngerRelaxationText">Learning to use relaxation and meditative techniques will help you to remain calm during the more stressful periods in life. By learning how to stay calm we give ourselves the time to assess a situation and work out how best to deal with it.</string>
  
  <string name="AngerForgiveTitle">Learn to forgive</string>
  <string name="AngerForgiveText">Being forgiving of others will keep you in tune with your own emotions, and bring about a more understanding and empathetic viewpoint. You will find that you more often understand the reasons why other people are angry and, in turn, how your own anger manifests itself. You may find that your anger is a symptom of fear or anxiety, but you will easier forgive others by gaining a deeper understanding.</string>
  
  <string name="AngerCountTenTitle">Count to 10</string>
  <string name="AngerCountTenText">One of the simplest and, at times, the most immediately effective method of dealing with outbursts of anger. The more angry you feel the higher, perhaps, you may need to count, but the result is a chance for your mind not to become chaotic and filled with the rushing thoughts that anger can often cause.</string>
  
  <string name="AngerDistractionTitle">Distraction</string>
  <string name="AngerDistractionText">Distraction is a mindfulness technique that allows the mind to break from a negative source and focus on something more positive. Play games, or music, write, paint; anything that you enjoy will quickly make anger ebb away if it has become a focus for you. Being absorbed in pleasurable activities leaves no room for those negative frustrations that make you angry.</string>
  
  <string name="AngerDeepBreathsTitle">Deep breaths</string>
  <string name="AngerDeepBreathsText">Often associated with \'counting to ten\' for dealing with angry feelings - both work well! Deep breathing helps to relieve tension in the body, calms the nerves and helps you to level your feelings during those stressful moments.</string>
  
  <string name="AngerDontDenyTitle">Don\'t deny your anger</string>
  <string name="AngerDontDenyText">Your anger is a resultant emotion - denying it, or ignoring it, is missing the opportunity to understand what causes it. Your anger may be caused by fear, of a person or situation. It may be that you are aggrieved by a perceived, or real, injustice. Perhaps your drive into work leaves you irritable and prone to anger? These underlying reasons can be tackled, particularly if you use Thought Records and the Problem Solver to help you identify and deal with them.</string>
  
  <string name="AngerJournalTitle">Write a journal</string>
  <string name="AngerJournalText">Keeping a journal allows you to express anger in a safe way, that doesn\'t hurt anyones feelings, including your own. Getting it \'off your chest\' in this way gives you the opportunity to look back on it at a later date, when the feelings have subsided, and be more objective about a person or situation than perhaps you were originally.</string>
  
  <string name="AngerTriggersTitle">Be aware of triggers</string>
  <string name="AngerTriggersText">Knowing what triggers aggressive or angry feelings can help you to plan to avoid them. We mentioned driving into work as a possible cause of anxiety or frustration. Could you change your route to make it an easier (not necessarily shorter!) journey? Would a train or bus be better? Planning in this way is empowering in that you take control of the anger by not allowing it the opportunity to arise. Reducing a triggers frequency is to reduce its power to induce strong emotional response.</string>
  
  <string name="AngerTalkTitle">Talk to someone about how you feel</string>
  <string name="AngerTalkText">Be it a family member, a friend or a medical professional, talking over your feelings with someone else can help you gain a fresh perspective on situations or relationships that become stressful. Anger can easily cloud our judgement, and it may be very useful to simply talk to someone not directly involved, as they may have insight you had not anticipated.</string>

  <string name="AnxietyIdentifyTitle">Identify what is distressing you</string>
  <string name="AnxietyIdentifyText">Use the Thought Recording of Mind Your Mood to assess those situations causing you to become anxious. This will give you the opportunity to take an objective view of what things cause you to worry. Can you challenge your automatic reactions with evidence that does not support your thinking? Are there alternative ways of viewing the problem?</string>

  <string name="AnxietyPlanWorryTitle">Put worry in your planner</string>
  <string name="AnxietyPlanWorryText">Make a date with your worries and only consider them at that time. Use the Appointment or Activity planners to set aside some time which you will devote to considering the things that are causing you to stress, and tell yourself that you are not going to think about them until the appointed time. Using this method will help you to see that you do, indeed, have more control over worry than you may realise. It will take some practise, but you will find that your anxiety level will decrease when you are not thinking of your problems throughout the day.</string>

  <string name="AnxietyDeepBreathsTitle">Deep breaths</string>
  <string name="AnxietyDeepBreathsText">When we are panicky or stressed, our breathing tends to become shallow and short - it\'s a classic sign. By simply focusing on our breathing, and altering each breath to a deeper more relaxed one, we can move the body into a more relaxed state which will ease the anxiety we may be feeling.</string>

  <string name="AnxietyLookAroundTitle">Look around you</string>
  <string name="AnxietyLookAroundText">Feeling anxiety and stress means that we have narrowed our focus on to one particular thing at a given moment. A way to counter this is to try to widen the perspective of that moment and allow other stimulii from your body and your environment to share the moment with whatever causes you to stress out. Watch birds flying overhead, a car passing by or just move around to let yourself know that the world is still out there. Noticing that you are not stuck or tied to being alone with the worry can alleviate those difficult feelings of anxiety when they occur.</string>

  <string name="AnxietyGoSomewhereTitle">Go somewhere else</string>
  <string name="AnxietyGoSomewhereText">Anxiety may creep up on you wherever you are. You may stress over something that is not related to your location or present activity. You may, for example, start to worry over a work issue whilst in bed trying to get to sleep. Get out of bed and read for a while, or watch some TV, and only go back to bed when you are ready to sleep. Change your surroundings and shift the minds focus, even for a little while, and it will teach you how to break those cycles that one easily falls into.</string>

  <string name="AnxietyRepetitionTitle">Repetition</string>
  <string name="AnxietyRepetitionText">Take a moment to think about, say, the clothing or jewelry that you wear. Do you stop noticing that you are wearing that ring or pair of shoes? Your body has a way of blocking that constant stimulus and you can forget you are wearing that necklace or pair of shoes. Try the same thing with the cause of your anxiety. Repeat it to yourself slowly over and over again. At first you may feel more anxious but, as you continue to repeat the same thing many times, its power will weaken and your mind will have trouble focusing on it so much - it becomes bored with the repetitiveness of what you are saying to yourself. Do this for five to ten minutes and, if you have not tried it before, start by repeating something that is neutral to confirm to yourself it is a technique that works.</string>

  <string name="AnxietyRelaxTitle">Learn to relax</string>
  <string name="AnxietyRelaxText">When we say \'learn\' to relax, we mean exactly that. It takes effort and practise to teach yourself how to relax properly; you should aim to do this during calm and quiet periods of your day so that you can focus the method chosen. Deep breathing exercises, flexing and releasing muscles, gentle stretching or yoga will all assist you in de-stressing your body. Take a long shower and let your mind focus on the feeling of the water on your skin, or use visualisation techniques to ease a worried mind. The more you practise, the quicker it will be for these techniques to bring about a calm state of being.</string>

  <string name="AnxietyProblemSolveTitle">Problem Solve</string>
  <string name="AnxietyProblemSolveText">We can easily become anxious because our worries or problems may seem insurmountable and too big to resolve. Use the Problem Solving part of Mind Your Mood to help you to identify the issue in more detail, breaking it down into more manageable steps that can be tackled one at a time. Further subdivide a step by brainstorming ideas and assessing the pros and cons of each idea. You can then select the idea that seems most likely to allow you to resolve a step of your problem. In this way, you will be able to approach a solution without being overwhelmed with the bigger picture.</string>

  <string name="AnxietyLetGoTitle">Let go</string>
  <string name="AnxietyLetGoText">Learn to recognise that there may be only so much that you are able to do about any given problem. Would you expect to solve world hunger with simply the contents of your fridge? Of course you wouldn\'t! There are going to be many occasions where there is only so much that it is possible for you to do, and no more. When you are able to see this you will be better placed to let go of any lingering anxiety surrounding the issue that has been worrying you. Letting go in this way can be difficult at first and, like relaxation, requires some effort and practise on your part for it to begin working for you but, over the course of time, you will start to realise what you can change and what is out of your scope.</string>

  <string name="AnxietyDietTitle">Change your diet</string>
  <string name="AnxietyDietText">Try to steer clear of caffeine and alcohol, as these can ultimately make you feel anxiety. Don\'t eat too many sugary foods, but replace them with fresh fruit and vegetables. Drink green, or peppermint, teas as these are gentler on the stomach. It is well known that your physical health is closely tied to your mental health, and improvement in one generally brings about a positive change in the other.</string>

  <string name="AnxietyGetActiveTitle">Get active</string>
  <string name="AnxietyGetActiveText">At whatever level you feel able, try to get more exercise on a daily basis. This could be something as simple as deciding to walk to a store instead of getting in the car to drive there. Swimming or yoga can make you feel good, and are not too demanding if it has been a while since you have done any workouts. It is even better if you feel able to participate in team sports, as you benefit from human interaction whilst boosting your body\'s natural endorphins.</string>

  <string name="AnxietyDoEnjoyTitle">Do what you enjoy</string>
  <string name="AnxietyDoEnjoyText">It probably goes without saying that being able to do the things you enjoy will always give you the benefit of making you feel better if you have been feeling anxiety or stress. Make sure to tell yourself that the time you will spend doing your favourite things is for those things only, and you are not to think about the things that may stress you. Tell yourself that you deserve a break, that it won\'t hurt to do so, that you are allowed to enjoy yourself and that you need to have that time for the good of your mental and physical well-being. Perhaps there is a new pastime you\'ve always wanted to try, or a language you wanted to learn? Considering new pursuits widens your social network and opens a world beyond any problems you may be having which can, in itself, give you a better perspective on things.</string>

  <string name="SuicidalDoNothingTitle">Do nothing for five minutes</string>
  <string name="SuicidalDoNothingText">When the thoughts and emotional pain become unbearable, and suicide seems the only way out, just stop - for five minutes, simply stop what you are doing and do nothing except tell yourself you will do nothing for the next five minutes. When those five minutes have elapsed you will have proved to yourself that you can do it for another five minutes, so do the same again - it\'s only five minutes after all! During this five minutes you should aim to use the following step...</string>

  <string name="SuicidalHelpNowTitle">Get Help Now</string>
  <string name="SuicidalHelpNowText">Use the Mind Your Mood \'Help Now\' button to call your emergency contacts, email or text friends or relatives or trusted professionals. Keep a written list if it is easier, and place it by your phone so you can contact them right away. It doesn\'t really matter whether you intend to act on these thoughts or not because asking for help is the right thing to do in either case, and you can be sure that loved ones would rather you ask them to help you than not.</string>

  <string name="SuicidalSafePlaceTitle">Go to a safe place</string>
  <string name="SuicidalSafePlaceText">Use the Mind Your Mood \'Safe Places\' in the Safety Plan to keep a list of the places you can go to in order to keep yourself safe. This may be staying with family or friends nearby, a local hospital Accident and Emergency department, support group, etc. Keep a set of Calm Cards for different circumstances and times of day so you don\'t have to think about your strategy at the time you are feeling vulnerable. Swipe to the most appropriate card and then carry out its instructions.</string>

  <string name="SuicidalDontDrinkTitle">Don\'t do drink or drugs</string>
  <string name="SuicidalDontDrinkText">Self-medicating using alcohol or drugs will only lead to further confusion or a deterioration in your coping abilities.</string>

  <string name="SuicidalSafetyPlanTitle">Devise your Safety Plan</string>
  <string name="SuicidalSafetyPlanText">It is very important to have a Safety Plan in place. When you are vulnerable enough to be having suicidal thoughts you are clearly not thinking straight, you may feel confused and frightened.  Make sure you are feeling calm when you devise your plan so that you can best decide what needs to be done, how to identify the warning signs that your condition is worsening, and give accurate information for all the sections of the Safety Plan in Mind Your Mood. Use it as a tool to reference your strategy in advance, and to keep you safe before things get too bad.</string>

  <string name="SuicidalSafetyHomeTitle">Safety at home</string>
  <string name="SuicidalSafetyHomeText">Don\'t keep over the counter medication at home unless absolutely necessary, and even then keep it to a relatively safe amount. If you get monthly prescriptions for medication that can be overdosed on, ask your doctor to change them to weekly ones if you feel that you\'re overly vulnerable. You could give them to a family member or trusted friend to bring to you on a daily basis, removing them from your home completely. Make sure that any tools or kitchen utensils are out of reach. Make them more difficult to get to than they would normally be. Lock them away, or put them on a high shelf or the back of a cupboard and don\'t make them easy for you to get to.</string>

  <string name="SuicidalTriggersTitle">Know your triggers</string>
  <string name="SuicidalTriggersText">Identify the things you know may trigger those difficult thoughts. List them in \'Warning Signs\' of your Safety Plan in Mind Your Mood. Review them daily to see if your mood is deteriorating so you can decide to get help before things begin to overwhelm you. Track your moods daily using the \'Mood Rating\' of your Thought Record, and keep an eye on it every day to help you see when things are getting on top of you or which events and situations trigger the dark emotions. Viewing your Progress Chart regularly will give you a visual way of seeing an increase in strength of the moods you are tracking over time, allowing you to take the appropriate action in advance.</string>

  <string name="SuicidalIsolatedTitle">Don\'t become isolated</string>
  <string name="SuicidalIsolatedText">Depressive illness can lead to one isolating oneself from others. Loneliness and isolation are breeding grounds for negative thinking, which is the last thing you need when you are in a vulnerable state. Go and stay with family or friends for a few days, find yourself a support group or community centre where you can meet up with people. You are most certainly not the only person to have had suicidal thoughts, and there are many, many others going through (or have been through) the same difficult situation as you. Talk about what is going through your mind and don\'t feel ashamed or less of a person for doing so; bringing things out into the open with other people who understand what you are going through may help provide you with new strategies to cope that you may not have considered before.</string>

  <string name="SuicidalLoveYourselfTitle">Love yourself</string>
  <string name="SuicidalLoveYourselfText">Try not to be too hard on yourself - quite often, we have a self-image formed more through our low feelings than in reality. Our thoughts can become distorted, making us think we are worse people than we really are. We\'ll sometimes convince ourselves that no-one cares about us because we are terrible people but, deep down, we know this is not true. But this doesn\'t match how we feel and, therefore, we must bridge the gap in some way - usually with a negative slant to it. Make sure you tell yourself that you are a good person, a good friend to have, a loving father, mother, wife or husband. Use the Affirmations of your Treatment Plan to provide positive mantras. Use the \'Tell Myself\' section of your Safety Plan to record positive statements about yourself. You are an amazing, unique, human being who deserves to be told that this is so. Give yourself a pat on the back for your Achievements, and record them in Mind Your Mood, no-matter how small they may seem on the face of it - they\'re your achievements and you should feel proud of them!</string>

  <string name="AboutText1">My name is Seb Quelcutti - and I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder.  It will come as no surprise to learn that the content of Mind Your Mood has been an aid to my own recovery but, it\'s creation has also been of great help to me over the last few months. Since you are now in possession of MYM, you know that the road can be very difficult at times - and you are not alone, by any stretch of the imagination!</string>
  <string name="AboutText2">By trade, I am a software developer, and have been so for about as long as I have had MDD (about 30 years - I\'m convinced the two are NOT related!) That\'s a long time for both! I could tell you all the gory detail of my illness but if, like me, you know what it\'s like to be in-and-out of hospital, having a Crisis Team in your home, struggling to keep working, losing relationships and all the other things that can be consequences of the dark cloud of depression, then you already know my story.</string>
  <string name="AboutText3">Mind Your Mood originally began life as a PC application. It came about during a stint of group Mindfulness therapy, during which I found that we were going through reams of paper related to recording our thoughts on a daily basis. To make things more convenient, I wrote a desktop application to take the place of filling out form after form. Instead, one could do it via the software. MYM for Android came about in mid-2016, after another hospital admission. I was looking for a project to get into to give me a goal to focus on, and to help me dig my way out of some of the debt that had piled up whilst I was off work for so many months. It has grown beyond the original thought recording of the desktop application - although, that is still part of the app - and is much more comprehensive now, feature-wise.</string>

  <string name="AboutText6">By downloading, and using, this software you agree that the Author is in no way liable for an individuals mental health issues, and that those issues are solely between an individual and their healthcare provider(s).</string>
  <string name="AboutText7">You, the user of Mind Your Mood, also agree that it is your responsibility to adhere to any medication regime specified by a healthcare professional, and that reliance on Mind Your Mood to provide reminders of when medication should be taken is ill-advised as it cannot be guaranteed that this feature will work, as written, on every device in the market place.  Whilst every effort has been made by the Author to ensure that reminders activate at the desired time (such as resetting reminders after a device reboot or an upgrade to the software), you agree that issues unforseen by the Author cannot be held as liability.</string>
  <string name="AboutText8">Installation of Mind Your Mood is performed at the users own risk. No liability will be held for any damage to a device in which the software is installed. Whilst Mind Your Mood does not include code that executes outside of the platform from which it was written, the Author cannot be held responsible for issues that arise from this third-party platform. Mind Your Mood was written in C# on the Xamarin platform and, by necessity, elements of this platform are required to be installed on the device along with Mind Your Mood itself.</string>
  <string name="AboutText9">Mind Your Mood does not, in any way through original code, store a users data anywhere but on the device that the software has been installed. Your data is never transmitted electronically to any third-party except for the use of the Google Speech Recognition, where voice data is transmitted for analysis and a textual version received in response.</string>
  <string name="AboutText10">Additionally, Mind Your Mood does not include in-app advertising or purchases, nor links to websites or other cloud-based content, and is the reason why a small charge is made for purchase of the software.</string>
  <string name="AboutText11">It is deemed exceptionally reasonable, for such a small fee, that the Author retains the right to decide whether an issue reported with Mind Your Mood is of sufficient importance to address in any specific update to the software. Whilst the Author will attempt to rectify as many issues as possible, you agree that this is not always possible and/or reasonable given the small charge for the software itself.</string>
